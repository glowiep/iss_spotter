# Overview
The international space station (ISS) is an orbital outpost circling high above our heads and completes multiple revolutions around Earth per day. Sometimes itâ€™s overhead, but when? It depends on your location. 

Given a location on Earth (latitude, longitude, and altitude) this app will compute the next number of times that the ISS will be overhead.

## The Approach
We'll be making API requests to three different services to solve this problem.

- Fetch our IP Address
- Fetch the geo coordinates (Latitude & Longitude) for our IP
- Fetch the next ISS flyovers for our geo coordinates


### Output
Running the app will produce an output like this:
```
> node index.js
Next pass at Fri Jun 01 2021 13:01:35 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time) for 465 seconds!
Next pass at Fri Jun 01 2021 14:36:08 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time) for 632 seconds!
Next pass at Fri Jun 01 2021 16:12:35 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time) for 648 seconds!
Next pass at Fri Jun 01 2021 17:49:29 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time) for 648 seconds!
Next pass at Fri Jun 01 2021 19:26:12 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time) for 643 seconds!
```

This is for all the space enthusiasts out there who are interested in spotting the International Space Station (ISS)!
